# Aussie AI Base C++ Library

You're still here? You haven't been replaced by code-regurgitating
robots yet? Well, then...Welcome to the Aussie AI codespace!

This repository is the Aussie AI Base C++ library, which implements a number of low-level Transformer and LLM
components and related algorithms from ML and linear algebra. It's also a sneaky way to
release all of the source code examples
for the book "Generative AI in C++" published in March 2024.

## Generative AI in C++ Book

This repository includes the C++ source code examples from 
the book "Generative AI in C++: Coding Transformers and LLMs" by David Spuler, March 2024.

Here are some more details about the book itself.
The full text of all chapters of the book is available online in HTML format (no login required):

## Programming Language Support

- C++ - All of the main code is written in C++ and that's about all that matters.
- C - This library does not compile as standard C, but some portions of it would quite easily.
- Java - To create a Java version of this library, create 100 subdirectories in hierarchies at least 6 layers deep,
put 10 ".java" files in each subdirectory, then copy-paste one line of C++ source into each Java file. Presto! You now have a Java version.
- Python - Feel free to create your own Python wrappers for this library, if you want it to run slower.

## Portability

This C++ code should compile on these platforms:

- Linux - build using the Makefile
- Microsoft Windows - build the project inside Microsoft Visual Studio (MSVS) IDE.
- MacOS - sorry, you're on your own for now.

Most of the code, except the AVX stuff and anything else I've forgotten about,
is standard portable C++ and should compile
pretty much anywhere after an hour or two of fighting with compiler warnings.

## Final Thoughts

Always try to be positive, except for blood tests.
